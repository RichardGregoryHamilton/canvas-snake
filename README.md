# Description

Snake is a classic arcade game, first released in the late 1970s. The player maneuvers a line resembling a snake. The objective is to eat
apples that appear on the screen while avoiding the walls and the snake itself. 

The snake is constantly moving and grows in length by eating apples. This makes the game harder, as the longer snake takes up more space,
leaving you with less space to maneuver.

My goal was to offer more replay value to users. That's why I introduced a high score and achievements system. By completing various tasks,
users get rewarded. These might include earning a various score in a particular game, or achieving a cumulative score.

# Code Quality

A lot of effort took place to account for code quality. The code has been analyzed extensively and optimized according to best practices.
It was run through services such as JSLint and had to pass all of these tests. There were strict guidelines in place to ensure this project was maintainable.
